<h1>About this website</h1>

<p>
<cite>Unplanned Obsolescence</cite> is a blog from <a href="https://alexpetros.com/">Alex
  Petros</a>. It's his second blog, because his <a href="https://thefloatingcontinent.com/">first
  blog</a> didn't feel like the right place to rant about software lifespans, open source
development, and HTML.

<p>
Professionally, Alex is a core maintainer for <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a> and software
engineer based in New York City. He is currently freelancing, building software infrastructure for
non-software companies, developing a set of practices for building software infrastructure that
lasts a <em>really</em> long time with <em>very</em> little maintenance.

<p>
At some point he would like to do the same for municpal, state, and federal governments.
